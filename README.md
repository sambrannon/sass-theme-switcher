## Setup Instructions

This example uses npm and Bower for asset management and assumes you already have npm installed on your system.

First install npm packages from the project directory

    $ npm install

To edit styles, you'll need to run Gulp to process the Sass

    $ gulp

This will leave set up Gulp to watch the scss directory

That's pretty much it. Check out the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to see the site.
